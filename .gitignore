Nothing should be ignored based on the provided file changes. The modified files (`MainWindow.xaml.cs` and `ViewModels/MainViewModel.cs`) are source code files that should be tracked in version control. Since there are no build artifacts, dependency directories, temporary files, or other items that should be ignored, the .gitignore remains empty.
